MjazTools BlogTheme DOCMan

Description
-----------
I found out why there are so little (none at all?) publicly available themes for DOCman: it's a lot of hard work to make them! This one is intended to use as many styles of your Joomla! template as possible, so your DOCman layout will integrate nicely with the rest of your site. That means this theme will look different on every site -  sometimes ugly, sometimes pretty - it all depends on your template!
It includes a PNG fix for Internet Explorer 5.5 and 6. If it gives you any trouble, turn it off. It's known not to work with the JPG Flash Rotator module.

Compatibility
-------------
This component was tested using Joomla! v1.0.13 and v1.5RC3, and DOCman 1.4.0 RC1.
It just a template, so it probably can't do any harm, but still: use at own risk, and backup your site and your database before installation. But of course you already did that :-)

Installation
------------
You can easily install this theme using DOCman's theme installer.
- In the Joomla! backend, go to Components -> DOCman -> Themes.
- Click the 'Add' button. Browse fot the file and click 'Upload and Install' and 'Continue'
- Now select the theme and click 'Edit'
- Set 'Published' to Yes and change any settings you like
- Click Save
- Now go to Components -> DOCman -> Configuration -> Frontend
- Set Icon Size to 32x32
- Done!

Upgrade from older versions
---------------------------
Backup the themeConfig.php if desired, uninstall the old version and install the new one. Restore themeConfig.php

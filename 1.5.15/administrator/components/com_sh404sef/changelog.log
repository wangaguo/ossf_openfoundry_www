           (optionnally) 301-redirected to the same url with the correct case.

     [bug] Deactivated auto-redirect from non-sef to sef url when using
           index2.php, instead of using tmpl=component (Virtuemart does this for
           instance, when editing in frontend)
           Tracker #18061
     [new] Added workaround for SOBI2 handling of # of items per page. Now read
           from sobi configuration table and add number of items to end of url
           if global sh404sef (Always append #items per page) is switched on.
           This way, page content is always consistent against URL.
     [new] Filter on sef url list now also searches in non-sef urls (ie can
           filter for "com_content","com_user", "view=userlist" for instance)

           in url. Now also using POST values.

     [new] Support for Joomla router.php files. If a sh404sef native plugin is

           You can force one option or the other on a per component basis in
           sh404sef backend, under the "By component tab" using the "Do not
